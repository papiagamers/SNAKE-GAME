**PapiaGamer Snake Game**

Papia Gamers Snake Game is a modern, interactive Snake game built with **Python 3** using the **Tkinter** GUI framework. This game combines classic Snake gameplay with modern features such as **AI-controlled movement**, manual controls using **Arrow or W, A, S, D keys**, **level selection**, **fullscreen mode**, and **score tracking**. Designed for both beginners and experienced Python developers, it’s an ideal project for learning game logic, GUI programming, and deploying Python applications using Docker.

## Features

- **AI Mode**: The snake automatically moves toward the food using a simple AI algorithm, making it fun to watch and educational for AI beginners.  
- **Manual Control**: Players can take over the snake at any time using **Arrow keys** or **W, A, S, D keys**.  
- **Level Selection**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard levels to adjust the snake's speed for different skill levels.  
- **Main Menu**: An interactive main menu lets players start the game, select a level, or exit. The menu includes hover effects and sound cues for a more engaging experience.  
- **Fullscreen Mode**: The game dynamically adjusts to the screen size for an immersive experience.  
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score and level display in the game interface.
